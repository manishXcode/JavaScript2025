# JavaScript History
* So, you are starting **JavaScript**. Did you know that JavaScript is not the predecer of Java, it is a totally seperate programming language
* [Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich) is the developer of JavaScript. He developed JavaScript at Netscape in 1995.
* In the beaginig Brendan Eich developed a programming language names `Mocha` but it didn't work. Mocha didn't get that much popularity then he re-named it again into `LiveScript` at that time again didn't work. But they didn't loose there hope at that time `Java` is way more populer, so the developers of JavaSCript think and change the name from LiveScript to `JavaSCript` and now you are here learning this language.

* At this stage the purpose of JavaScript is to make web pages interactive and responsive inside Netscape(by the way it was a browser) at this time JavaScript was simple, interpreted, browser-only and primerly focused on form validation and small animations. But along with time it changes:

### 1996-1997 ~ Standardization
* Microsoft quickly released its own version: JScript for Internet Explorer.
* To avoid browser wars chaos, JavaScript was standardized as ECMAScript (by ECMA International).
* ECMAScript 1 (1997) became the official first edition of the standard.

### Late 1990s – Early 2000s – “DHTML” Era
* Web pages began mixing:
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * JavaScript
* Called Dynamic HTML (DHTML)
* Still plagued by cross-browser incompatibilities (JS was different in Netscape vs. IE)

### 2005 – AJAX Revolution
* Term “AJAX” coined (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)
* Big apps like Google Maps and Gmail started using background HTTP requests without page reloads
* Led to rich, interactive web apps → the start of the Web 2.0 era.

### 2009 – Node.js
* [Ryan Dahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Dahl) created Node.js:
    * Allowed JavaScript to run outside browsers.
    * Made JavaScript a server-side language.
* Massive shift:
    * JS no longer “just for browsers.”
    * Enabled full-stack JS development

###  2015 – ECMAScript 6 (ES6 / ES2015)
A milestone year:
* Modern features introduced:
    * let/const
    * Arrow function
    * Classes
    * Modules
    * Promises
    * Templet literals
    * Destruction
* Modern JS codebases largely use ES6 and newer

### 2016–2020s – Rapid Evolution
* ECMAScript updates became annual.
* Features added over time:
    * Async/Await
    * Optional chaining
    * Nullish coalescing
    * BigInt
    * Modules in browsers
* Tooling boom:
     * Webpack, Babel
     * TypeScript (typed superset of JS)
* Rise of frameworks:
    * React
    * Angular
    * Vue
    * Svelte and others

### Present Day 
* JS is everywhere:
    * Web browsers
    * Mobile apps (e.g. React Native)
    * Server-side (Node.js, Deno)
    * Desktop apps (Electron)
    * IoT, scripting, cloud functions
